This repository contain Projects for data science that i have done during **Lux Academy Data Science Bootcamp**

## Week One

In the first week of the data analysis project, several tasks were completed using Python and SQL to explore and analyze weather data. The activities included:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - **Loaded and examined the dataset:** Imported the weather data CSV file into a Jupyter Notebook using Pandas.
   - **Performed initial data checks:** Checked for null values, renamed columns for clarity, and reviewed basic statistics of the dataset.

2. **Data Analysis with SQL:**
   - **Imported Data into Database:** Moved the weather data into a MariaDB database.
   - **Executed SQL Queries:** Applied various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. The queries included:
     - Finding records where the weather was clear.
     - Counting occurrences of specific wind speeds.
     - Calculating the mean visibility.
     - Identifying records with high wind speed and specific visibility.
     - Extracting instances of clear weather with high humidity or visibility.

The SQL queries provided insights such as the number of clear weather records, the frequency of specific wind speeds, average visibility, and conditions meeting particular criteria. This process involved using SQL commands to filter and aggregate data, leading to a better understanding of the weather dataset.

This work laid the foundation for further analysis and model development in subsequent weeks.
